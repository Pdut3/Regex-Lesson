# Regex Tutorial
Welcome to the Regex Tutorial! This tutorial is designed to help you understand the basics of regular expressions (regex) and how to use them effectively in your coding endeavors. Whether you're a beginner or have some experience with regex, this tutorial will provide you with a solid foundation to work with.

# Summary
In this tutorial, we will explore the world of regular expressions and their powerful capabilities. We will cover various regex components, including anchors, quantifiers, grouping constructs, bracket expressions, character classes, the OR operator, flags, and character escapes. Each component will be explained in detail with examples to illustrate their usage and functionality.

# Regex Components
# Anchors
The "Anchors" section explains the purpose and usage of anchors in regex. Anchors allow you to match patterns at specific positions within a string, such as the start or end of a line or word.

# Quantifiers
The "Quantifiers" section delves into quantifiers and their role in specifying the repetition of elements in a regex. You will learn about the different quantifiers, such as the asterisk, plus, and question mark, and how to use them effectively.

# Grouping Constructs
The "Grouping Constructs" section introduces grouping constructs in regex. You will discover how to group parts of a regex together, capture matched values, apply quantifiers to multiple elements, and define alternations within a group.

# Bracket Expressions
The "Bracket Expressions" section focuses on bracket expressions, also known as character classes. You will learn how to define sets of characters or ranges within square brackets to match specific characters at a position in a regex.

# Character Classes
The "Character Classes" section explores predefined character classes, such as \d, \w, and \s, which provide shorthand notations for common character sets. You will understand how to utilize these classes to match digits, word characters, and whitespace.

# The OR Operator
The "The OR Operator" section introduces the OR operator (|), allowing you to specify multiple alternatives within a regex pattern. You will learn how to use the OR operator to match any of the provided alternatives.

# Flags
The "Flags" section explains the concept of regex flags and how they can modify the behavior of regular expressions. You will discover common flags, such as i, g, m, and others, and understand how they can enhance your regex matching capabilities.

# Character Escapes
The "Character Escapes" section focuses on character escapes or escape sequences in regex. You will learn about various escape sequences like \d, \w, \s, and others that match specific characters with special meanings.
